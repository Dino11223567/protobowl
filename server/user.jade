						| IMPORTANT: READ THIS MESSAGE
						| =====================================
						| Due to a strange bug in socket.io, Protobowl has a very limited capacity for users 
						| of long-polling based connectivity, such as is in the case of users of older browsers 
						| like Internet Explorer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (10 is okay though). Because 
						| here at Protobowl, we believe the Spock maxim holds true: "the needs of the many 
						| outweigh the needs of the few", you have been disconnected to reduce the latency 
						| of the entire protobowl user base, and to serve the needs of the many.
						| 
						| The solution for you is rather simple: get another browser.
