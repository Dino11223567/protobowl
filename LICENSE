This is actually the dummy license file. You have to email me to get the real one.

That's probably not a legally binding covenant, so you should probably assume that the code is under the most stringent and draconian copyright that is known to man (because that's the default, mua ha ha ha).

Seriously though, you should email us before attempting to do anything, because it'd be nice and because I'm a power hungry monstrawr.
