			You may very well ask why this file exists. The reason is actually not that simple. Protobowl, as it was from late 2012 to April 2013 supported offline, pretty much the way offline apps tend to be- it had a manifest file on the top of every page. This became a problem once a user had visited several pages, because each one was added as a master entry to the archive. Each page that someone visited would make updating slightly slower, and this is clearly bad.

			So this is why this file exists, it is more or less blank and it gets stored as the master file, but it's the only master file. It's just to be added as a frame to all the less masterful files.
